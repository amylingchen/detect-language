This course serves as a leveling course for Computer Science and Software Engineering Master's Degree students who need reinforcement of fundamental concepts.

Topics include, but are not limited to, computer architecture and organization, analysis of algorithms, data structures, operating systems, discrete structures, automata theory and grammars.

When your transcripts were reviewed by the Admissions Committee, it was determined that you were missing one or more foundation courses.

In order to address this deficiency, you were given probationary admission with the condition of taking leveling course CSE 5305 - Foundations of Graduate Level Studies in Computer Science during your first semester.

This course will prepare you for advanced graduate studies and will also count towards your degree.
CSE 5305 is intended to be a review of these topics.

If a given topic is not review for YOU, then you may want to request supplemental materials to understand the topic in more depth.

You will be expected to complete exercises over each topic and you will be tested over each topic.

This class is part of your degree and must be passed with a C or better.

If you do not earn a C or better, then you will be required to take this class again next semester.

Boolean is based around the logic that something is either True or False. Think of it like a light, it can either be on or off.

Computers follow Boolean Logic as they can only have two states, True or False.

Computers do not understand maybe, slightly or possible.

In Boolean Logic, we use 1 to represent True and a 0 to represent False.
