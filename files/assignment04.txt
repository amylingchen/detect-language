Description: 
Most (on-line) information is textual, there are many simple 
storage/indexing/retrieval systems that are quite useful built from simple tools. 
Here are some textual data tools that “glued” together are useful. 
 
We will give you several “documents” in textual (all in UTF-8 character set) 
format, note that you will need to “clean up” these documents to do some 
processing. Documents will between a few characters to about 1000 characters in 
length, there will be between 3 to 12 documents, in total.

Given some text: - clean (remove pictures, non-text, most punctuation – keep the following…) - separate into sentences (you kept the common sentence ending punctuation .?!) - find individual words in sentences (tab, space separated) ,
    index words within sentences (which document, where – could be an offset
    or sentence number) - count length of words, number of words in sentences - show, search for given words - count frequency of individual characters (only a..z), need to change any
   capital  letters to lower case.
- try to determine if in English (or not)  -

Recommended that this is done as on-line tool(s), bonus points if done on-line
You will need to demo your program and explain your implementation
All work submitted for evaluation MUST be your creation, however you are welcome
to use references AS LONG as you cite your references, you may similarly use
libraries and example code – PLEASE DO NOT just copy code or use libraries for
complex functionality or substantial parts.
